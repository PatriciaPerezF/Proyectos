# Python Projects.
Projects developed to practice python. Among them you will find:

* `calculadora` : It is a calculator, you must enter a number and choose between raising to the power or knowing the multiples (up to 12) of that number.
* `cuenta_regresiva.py`: The user must enter a number and a countdown is generated from that number to 1.* `conversor` : Money converter, you can convert from CLP (Chilean Pesos) to $ (USD) or vice versa.
* `fuerza_bruta.py` : Enter a series of alphabetic characters and the algorithm will take care of checking how many attempts are required
to hack a password by brute force.
* `genera_patron.py` : Enter a number, and that number corresponds to the number of rows that should be generated.
* `generador_contrasena` : This algorithm helps you to create strong passwords, containing letters, numbers and symbols.
* `lorem_generator.py` : Enter a number, and that number corresponds to the number of Lorem ipsum paragraphs to display.
* `menu_banco.py`: When executing it, it will show a bank menu with different options, You must choose the number of the action you want to perform and follow the instructions.
* `numeros_primos` : Enter a number to find out if it is prime.
* `palindromo`: Enter a word and find out if it is a palindrome.
* `piedra_papel_tijera.py` : Classic rock paper scissors game. The user must choose what to play and the algorithm will inform him the computer's choice and the result of the battle.
* `solo_impares.py` : The user must enter a number and all odd numbers will be displayed up to the entered number (if it is even).
* `solo_pares_refactor.py` : The user must enter a number and all even numbers will be displayed up to the entered number (if it is even).
* `suma_pares.py` : The user must enter a number and all even numbers are added up to the number entered (if it is even), showing which are the numbers added and the total of the mathematical operation.
* `videogame` : It's a game, you have to guess the number between 1 and 100, the algorithm will give you hints and you can do multiples iterations until you guess it.

The algorithm's outputs are in Spanish.
