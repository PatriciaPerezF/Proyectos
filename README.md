# Python Projects.
Projects developed to practice python. Among them you will find:

* `calculadora` : It is a calculator, you must enter a number and choose between raising to the power or knowing the multiples (up to 12) of that number.
* `conversor` : Money converter, you can convert from CLP (Chilean Pesos) to $ (USD) or vice versa.
* `generador_contrasena` : This algorithm helps you to create strong passwords, containing letters, numbers and symbols.
* `numeros_primos` : Enter a number to find out if it is prime.
* `palindromo`: Enter a word and find out if it is a palindrome.
* `videogame` : It's a game, you have to guess the number between 1 and 100, the algorithm will give you hints and you can do multiples iterations until you guess it.

The algorithm's outputs are in Spanish.
